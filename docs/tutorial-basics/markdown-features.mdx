# SQL WHERE Clause

## The SQL WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records.

It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.**[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

```text title="Example"
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

## Syntax

```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields

SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

```text title="Example"
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;
```

## Operators in The WHERE Clause

You can use other operators than the `=` operator to filter the search.

Below is a selection from the ''Customers'' table used in the examples:

```text title="Example"
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID > 80;
```
