[LEARNing SQL](http://localhost:3000/) is a website-building tool that enables you to create and share your website. 

In addition to a server, you get a **SQL Database** where you can store and access your data.

It's easy to use and doesn't require any setup.

With our online SQL editor, you can edit SQL statements, and view the result in your browser.

```js
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

<button onClick={() => alert('button clicked!')}>Try it by yourself!</button>
