[LEARNing SQL](http://localhost:3000/) is a website-building tool that enables you to create and share your website. 

In addition to a server, you get a **SQL Database** where you can store and access your data.

It's easy to use and doesn't require any setup.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2023-12-01-sql.md`
- `2023-11-30-sql/index.md`

With our **online SQL editor**, you can edit the SQL statements, and click on a button to view the result.
